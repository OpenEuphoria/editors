Euphoria syntax highlighting for Notepad++
Created by Greg Haberek <ghaberek@gmail.com>

We have included three separate configurations:

  euphoria.xml   - plain Euphoria syntax
  win32lib.xml   - plain Euphoria with Win32Lib syntax
  wxeuphoria.xml - plain Euphoria with wxEuphoria syntax

You'll probably want to import just one file for whichver library you use most often.

To import these user-defined language files:

  1. Click View > User-Defined Dialogue...
  2. Click Import...
  3. Select a file and click Open
  4. The new language will show up at the bottom of your "Language" menu

Notes:
  - These files were built using Notepad++ 5.9.3; they may not work correctly on older versions.
  - Unfortunately, there is a 15-character limit to the "name" on a user-defined language.
